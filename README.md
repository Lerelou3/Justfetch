## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the excellent work of:
- [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch) - A pretty system information tool
- [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) - A fast neofetch-like system information tool
- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) - A command-line system information tool

## ⚠️ Note

This is an amateur project made for fun and learning purposes. While it aims to be functional and useful, it may not have all the features of more mature system information tools.
